# Libre-Pehechaan
An open source version of Pehechaan, AI enabled ID verification systems

## About
Pehechaan is an ID verification system that uses computer vision techniques to completely remove humans from any ID verification process for the sake of privacy

## How it works?
Pehechaan has a PyTorch backend and uses multiple libraries for face detection, face comparison and ocr
